timeouts:
  icloudDownloadSeconds: 1800        # 30 minutes - time to download from iCloud

# ============================================================================
# Folders to Backup (REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# You must specify which folders to backup
# Run 'kodema list' to discover your iCloud folders!
include:

# Incremental Backup Settings (for 'kodema backup' command)
# ============================================================================
backup:
  # Remote path prefix in B2 bucket
  remotePrefix: "backup"
  
  # Time Machine-style retention policy
  # This creates a graduated backup schedule:
  # - Recent: Keep everything (highest detail)
  # - Medium term: Keep daily snapshots
  # - Long term: Keep weekly/monthly snapshots
  retention:
    hourly: 24      # Keep ALL snapshots from last 24 hours
    daily: 30       # Keep ONE snapshot per day for last 30 days
    weekly: 12      # Keep ONE snapshot per week for last 12 weeks (~3 months)
    monthly: 12     # Keep ONE snapshot per month for last 12 months

  # Manifest update frequency
  # Update the snapshot manifest every N successfully uploaded files
  # This prevents orphaned files if backup is interrupted
  # Lower = more reliable but more API calls, Higher = fewer API calls but more orphans on interrupt
  # Default: 50 (reasonable balance)
  manifestUpdateInterval: 50
  
  # Example retention schedules for different needs:
  
  # MINIMAL (for testing)
  # retention:
  #   hourly: 6      # Last 6 hours
  #   daily: 7       # Last week
  #   weekly: 4      # Last month
  #   monthly: 3     # Last quarter
  
  # STANDARD (recommended for most users)
  # retention:
  #   hourly: 24     # Last day
  #   daily: 30      # Last month
  #   weekly: 12     # Last 3 months
  #   monthly: 12    # Last year
  
  # AGGRESSIVE (more backups, more storage)
  # retention:
  #   hourly: 48     # Last 2 days
  #   daily: 90      # Last 3 months
  #   weekly: 52     # Last year
  #   monthly: 24    # Last 2 years
  
  # LONG-TERM ARCHIVE
  # retention:
  #   hourly: 24     # Last day
  #   daily: 30      # Last month
  #   weekly: 12     # Last 3 months
  #   monthly: 60    # Last 5 years

# ============================================================================
# Mirror Settings (for 'kodema mirror' command)
# ============================================================================
mirror:
  # Remote path prefix in B2 bucket
  remotePrefix: "mirror"

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================

# File paths:
# - Use ~ for home directory (e.g., ~/Documents)
# - Absolute paths work too (e.g., /Volumes/Backup)

# Glob patterns:
# - * matches anything except /
# - ** matches anything including /
# - ? matches single character
# - [abc] matches a, b, or c
# - Patterns are case-insensitive on macOS

# Retention policy:
# - 'hourly: 24' means "for the last 24 hours, keep ALL snapshots"
# - 'daily: 30' means "for the last 30 days, keep ONE snapshot per day"
# - Older snapshots are automatically deleted by 'kodema cleanup'
